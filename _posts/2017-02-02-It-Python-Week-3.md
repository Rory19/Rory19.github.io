    <td>In today's lesson I found that again like last week using the hint section was extremely helpful this week as well as the others. Another new tip I thought about and used this lesson was asking others for advice and just in general asking if they could spot or detect anything I had done wrong.</td>

    <td>I feel considering the time we had I used it really well as unlike last week I wasn't chatting as much or none at all . But this listen I was feeling a lot more tired than previous lesson as we had just been to German so I was tired after a long journey</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well next lesson I hopefully won't be as tired as I was this lesson so that will really help. I will also keep up all of my previous strategies as they seem to be working really well at the moment. As we didn't have as much time this lesson I will have more next lesson so I will have more learning time.</td>
