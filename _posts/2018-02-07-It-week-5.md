In today's lesson we began to start our coding for our buzzfeed quiz we began by exporting our buzzfeed questions into repl. We start off with our key/main question and then followed with our other small questions I.e the ones that determine what you our ultimate answer is.

We started off by being shown how to start coding our questions and how to lay it out and how to position our question.

In today's lesson I believed I worked effectively and well with the time we were given. I was able to complete the work and understand it. I believe I complete my work to go level.

Next lesson I hope to elaborate on my code and complete my code for our buzzfeed quiz or to at least move a big step towards finishing.
