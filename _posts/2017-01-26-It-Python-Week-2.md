    <td>Well in today's lesson I found that using the same tactics from last week were really effective these included : looking at the tip section if you were stuck was really helpful, I also found that ready the words and instructions exactly was very important as missing out a letter or not using the correct punctuation. But a new strategy I found this lesson was reading between the lines to look for great advice.          </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found that in this lesson I was a bit chatty which did pay its slight toll on my work but also found that the fact I did find some parts quite challenging as I didn't read all of the instructions as was rushing quite a lot throughout today's lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week I will remember to take my time and read the whole of the instructions. I will also make sure to continue giving my 100% to all of my work and I will keep up with my strategies I fund as they really did help me out a lot. I will tone down the chatter to make sure that I don't get distracted and can speed up on my work.</td>
