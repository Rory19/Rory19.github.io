In today's lesson we looked at a different type of Python on repl we looked at a python called Python turtle where we were able to create a turtle that was able to make any shape we please even if it didnâ€™t fit on the screen. We were able to do this by either giving it the angle between each side or the number of sides and it could make a regular shape from that.

We moved on to it making multiple shapes at one time which I found I worked very well at a consistent level. Our goal was to have it make 17 shapes starting with a triangle the least sided shape. We were able to change things like turtle speed, leg length of the lines, line colour and more. However we strangely moved on to a website were we created images with like waves of colour.
