    <td>In today's lesson we started off by reviewing a new coding platform which uses a different type of python. We started off by creating a joke where we had to create either a time limited for the answer or wait for user input. We than went to front were our Teacher explained how to solve it. The main thing was that instead of just having speech marks you need to have brackets and than speech marks.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found that in today's lesson we all went a lot slower than usual as none of us had really understood this new code but it was very similar to Codecadamy python as it uses mainly the rules. I was extremely chatty this lesson which could have slowed me down further but most of the chatting was asking about the work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will hopefully be more familiar with this type of python and will be able to use my Codecadamy skills as well. I will also not chat as much which will allow me to do a lot more work as I won't get distracted. Will also hopefully have more time next lesson as in this lesson it was mainly a taster of what's install for us. </td>
