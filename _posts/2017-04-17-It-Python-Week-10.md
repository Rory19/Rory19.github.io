    <td>We started off by using Repl the same coding software as we used last week to create a code that would be able to tell us the area and perimeter of certain shapes. I found that all though Repl is a different site to codecadamy many of the same rules apply so I used them to help. Another important method was to listen carefully to our teacher when he was explaining things as they were very helpful.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In terms of time we were given I believe I used it very effectively as when I could understand something I pointed it a friend who helped clear it up. But possibly I could have chatted a bit too much in this lesson. But we weren't given much time to do our work as most of the time  Mr Keen was explaining what we had to do in the lesson and for homework</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sadly this was our last It lesson of the year but I will still say what I should improve on. Next time I will tone down the chat from this lesson so I can focus it more on my work I will also keep using all the time I was given effectively. I will make sure that next lesson I will keep up the standard of my work through out the year.</td>
