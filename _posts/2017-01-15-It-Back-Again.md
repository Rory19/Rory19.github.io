    <td>In today's lesson we moved on from Fuze as in today's lesson we had to make sure that our blog is working the best way to see if your blog was working is to click settings and if there is anything prohibiting your blog from working it will come up in red. I found that if you keep reading the problem in red it will say which line the error is on and how to fix that.</td>
