In today's lesson we focused at looking at buzzfeed quiz which are basically community built quiz which for example are what Disney character are you or what breed of dog are you.Now there are a number of different ways they can get the answer for example it could just be complete random and the questions are just there, they have nothing to do with the final answer. 

Another way they could achieve it is via a point system let's take the Hogwarts houses for example, every time you choose answer 1 you get 1 point 2 you 2 etcâ€¦ and at the end if you have between 10-18 points your Slytherin and 18-26 Ravenclaw, 26-34 Hufflepuff and 34-40 Gryffindor.

You could also just have just one question that corresponds to the end answer and the others are just there to make it seem more advanced.

The final way I can think of is to take the answer you answer the most so if you answer questions 1-3 with A, 4-6 with B and 6-10 with c you will get the item with corresponds with C.

For my Buzzfeed quiz I have decided to go with the points system as I feel it will work slot better than for example the random ones.

I really enjoyed today's lesson as it was different, and was something new and fun.I believed I work effectively and to a good standard as I was able to compete have of my questions in the lesson. My topic is which fast food are you and it consists of 7 questions as my method needs this to get an average.
