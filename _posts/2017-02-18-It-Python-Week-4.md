    <td>In today's lesson speed was key but also precision was vital as if we weren't careful we would be leaving behind many mistakes. I also found that using previous knowledge just really help as with it you would be a lot clearer on what is going on. Again like last week asking your others really helped as they may have previously done it before.I also didn't talk nearly as much as I did last time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I didn't get off to the best start as I was really stuck on one of the exercise as it was a brand new section and none of the people around me had done it either. I was again a bit tired and chatty towards the end of the lesson.This lesson I found that since I did a new topic I was really too familiar with this. I also started to find the work more challenging than it was previously. I will need to make sure that I’m still fully working on python and not just asking small random things to my neighbour.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I hopefully won’t be as tired and will definitely wont chat as much. I will be more familiar with python. Next time I will keep up the pace and precision from this lesson which in my opinion was very good Next lesson I will be a lot more familiar with with this topic and will hopefully be able to take away a couple tips to use in further lessons. I will try to keep up the pace and precision in my work. I will hopefully have some tips and further knowledge to use in the next lesson to help improve my learning.</td>
