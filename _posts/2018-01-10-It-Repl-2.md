In today's lesson we continued doing repl we went over our homework which involved creating 3 more questions with consequences I.e . If I asked what is your favourite food a burger or pasta the consequences would be "My favourite is a burger too!" Or “I prefer burgers rather than pasta”. Our topic was creating loops these loops include while loops and for loops which are essentially. A while loop means if so basically if this happens print this or that. However a for loop is better  as if you want it to happen a certain amount of times you can choose that.Our exercise was to look at a child’s pocket money how he starts of by getting 2p but each week it gets doubled. This was rather confusing asdoubled. I found this lesson very effective and I worked well in the time I was given I knuckled down and did well.
