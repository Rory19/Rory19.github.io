    <td>I read through the tips section which was very helpful in me reaching my targets without this it would have taken a lot longer to be successful l. We also read out the code to our partners so that they didn't have to keep looking down booklet . Which will increase our speed which really helped both of our targets in the long run .</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That there was quite a noisy atmosphere in today's lesson which slightly prohibited learning but wasn't the only reason the other reason was that i screen kept reason which half way through the lesson we were able to fix by shutting the whole system down.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will get the booklet straight to the right page compared to today when i took a while trying to find the right exercise but i will also do 3 exercises each compared to one each which wasted a lot of time changing over to the other person.</td>
