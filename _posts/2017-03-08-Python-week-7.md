  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the hint section for each section on Codecadamy  and by reading through the lines to see any hidden information. I also used my previous knowledge to help me. Again like every week I continued to use the same tips and continued to ask those around me if they knew what I was missing or what I had done wrong. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found that I spent a lot more of my time on the harder exercises as they require a lot more time and thought. I also was again chatty which I am finding hard to stop. I'm also not too confident this lesson due to me starting a new topic but I will be more familiar with it next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will keep up the speed and precision in my work as I was able to complete a lot of work in todayâ€™s lesson compared to any other. I will be able to do the harder exercises hopefully a bit more easily as I have become more confident and know a lot more about them. I will also be on an exercise I already know so will be quite easy.</td>
