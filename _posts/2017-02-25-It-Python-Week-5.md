    <td>In today's lesson similarly to last week I continued to apply me previous knowledge which again like last week real helped me out. I also continued to check back on all my work to make sure it all made sense and or worked correctly. But this week I made sure to thoroughly read the instructions and read in between the lines.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited me this week were roughly the same as last as I was still unfamiliar with this new section. I was also quite a bit chatty but I don't think it limited my learning too much though. It could be said that our teacher distracted us as well.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I hope that I won't be interrupted by teacher like last week , I will also try slough hard to stop chatting in the lesson time , in the next lesson I will be more familiar with Piglatin to help aid me.</td>
