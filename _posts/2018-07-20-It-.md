In today's lesson we worked on scratch continuing to work on creating a game. My game which could be seen as very similar to pinball is where you can pick a target on the board and aim for a target zone the points and size of theses zones all varied determining on the amount of points. 25-large 50-medium 75-medium 100-small and 500-miniscule. Each person was allowed 5 shots points would then be added up towards the end and bill give you an amount of bullets to fight a boss.
