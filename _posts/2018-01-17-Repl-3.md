In today's lesson we focused on random...

Random, Random isn't what we think we think it will just scroll through and pick a i team of our selection however it doesn't work like that. People complained about things being completely random as for example we could ask for 3 random numbers between 1-10 and we get 1 2 3 people complained as they would probably think they would get 2 6 8 or something similar numbers not next to each other.

This was also the same for Spotify as people got 3 songs in the same order from the same album. Now random has rules such as for example numbers not in the same order or at least a certain amount apart in the number line. Many companies have taken these rules / guidelines such as apple.

Random is no longer truly random. In fact our perception of random is the opposite to what random can be. We have change random to not be random but logical. Our common perspective on random has change it.
