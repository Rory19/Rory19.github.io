**Repl week 1:**

In today's lesson we went to Repl which is a coding software in which we used Python 3 to work on code. We started off by hearing Sir explain all the old fundamentals which we had forgotten about in the last year. I found repl rather hard as by the end of the lesson I saw I had a syntax error on line 9 which I didn’t know at the time what it meant. "**A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language. For compiled languages, syntax errors are detected at compile-time. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected**"I was later able to correct this for homework with ease. I found however in today’s lesson I worked well and effectively considered the time I had in which to complete it. I asked someone sitting near me once when I wasn’t sure what this error message was implying but after that I really knuckled down to fix it.

Despite not having much time after mainly being explained what to do and how to do I think I work well this lesson and was able to complete the work( not looking forward to the homework but what can you do)
