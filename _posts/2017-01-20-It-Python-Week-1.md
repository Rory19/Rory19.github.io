    <td>I found that as I wasn't really familiar with python I found that listening to Mr Keen was really important as he was able to give me information I didn't know over whose and the information he gave was really helpful. I also thought that the Tip box was also helpful as it just cleared up any issues I had in that exercise.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that as I spent a lot of time customising my details I got really distracted from the actual python work we were meant to be doing. I also thought that as talked a lot that I could have not been giving my 100% towards this work. I also feel that I could have just thought about it more as when I was stucked I started to guess which sometimes worked.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will definitely spend all of my available time working purely on python and I will make sure I continue to listen to Mr Keens advise because without it I probably would have struggled as he explained the ins and outs of python. I will keep looking in the Tip Box whenever i'm stuck or lost.</td>
