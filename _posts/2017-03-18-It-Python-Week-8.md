    <td>Today's lesson was a weird one as we had are blogs marked whilst doing a bit of Codecadamy and than doing a couple changes to our blogs. I found that for marking are blogs a good strategy was to write down our teachers advise and then found out it's meaning on W3 schools. But for Codecadamy I basically used the same tactics I had previously like reading between the lines, ask partners for their opinion and even although obvious make sure you completely understand the question.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In terms of what limited my blog mark it was down to having to restart my blog multiple times as it either didn't or I just didn't feel itâ€™s style / design. In terms of my Codecadamy we didn't have as much time as previous lesson as we had to have our teachers are blogs and than update them from the targets he set us.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will hopefully be able to have more time in order to do more work on Codecadamy. Next time I will use the advice my teacher which was to change my background colour , make the width 100 , put padding on the cells and to change my back ground colour all in which can be found in the css file. Now that I have taken these in to consideration I am a lot happier with the look of my blog and its content.</td>
